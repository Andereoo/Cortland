## Description

This is is a collection of CSS code that changes the look and feel of Firefox. 

Cortland turns the default UI of Firefox into an intuitive, modern interface, and supports both both light and dark themes, too!

This theme currently supports MacOS and Linux. Windows is not supported (yet). Firefox 70+ is recommended. 

## Installation

1. Download this project.
2. Go to <ins>about:support</ins> in Firefox.
3. Under `Application Basics` > `Profile Directory`, click the `Open Directory` button.
4. Copy the `chrome` folder from this project into the profile directory folder.
5. Go to <ins>about:config</ins>. 
    * Click `Accept the Risk and Continue`. 
    * Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
7. Open the Firefox menu (☰) and click `Customize...`. 
    * Ensure that the `Title Bar` checkbox is unchecked. 
    * Drag the new tab button out of the tabbar and into the headerbar.
9. Restart Firefox.
10. Enjoy your new Firefox theme!

## Additional notes

If you are using Firefox Nightly or another version of Firefox with the proton theme, instead of clicking the menu (☰) and clicking `Customize...`, click `More tools`, and then click `Customize toolbar...`.
